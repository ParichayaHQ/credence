# Credence

A decentralized identity and trust score network built in Go.

## Overview

Credence provides privacy-preserving trust scores that are verifiable and usable across applications without requiring global financial settlement. The system uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and a P2P network to enable gasless operations while maintaining Sybil resistance.

## Architecture

See [docs/designs/architecture.md](docs/designs/architecture.md) for detailed system design.
