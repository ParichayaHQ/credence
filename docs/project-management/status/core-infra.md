# Credence Core Infrastructure Development Plan

## Overview
Building the foundational components for the Credence decentralized identity and trust score network. This Core Infrastructure will provide shared libraries, schemas, and primitives that all other teams depend on.

## Development Checklist

- [x] Set up basic project configuration files
- [x] Create initial README and documentation structure

### Phase 2: Event System Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Define canonical event schemas (Vouch, Report, Appeal, RevocationAnnounce)
- [x] Implement JSON canonicalization (deterministic serialization)
- [x] Create event signing and verification interfaces
- [x] Build nonce generation and replay protection
- [x] Add event validation and type checking

### Phase 3: Cryptographic Primitives ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Ed25519 key generation, signing, and verification
- [x] Add BLS threshold signature support (interfaces defined)
- [x] Integrate VRF (Verifiable Random Functions) interfaces 
- [x] Create secure random number generation utilities
- [x] Build key derivation and management utilities

### Phase 4: Content Addressing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement CID (Content Identifier) generation using SHA-256 multihash
- [x] Create content-addressed storage interfaces
- [x] Add IPFS-compatible CID handling
- [x] Build blob storage and retrieval abstractions

### Phase 5: Core Data Structures ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Define DID (Decentralized Identifier) structures and methods
- [x] Implement VC (Verifiable Credential) handling with SD-JWT support
- [x] Create checkpoint and ruleset data structures
- [x] Build common configuration and error types
- [x] Add logging and telemetry interfaces

### Phase 6: Integration Framework ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up test utilities and fixtures
- [x] Create mock implementations for external dependencies
- [x] Build integration test harnesses
- [x] Add property-based testing for critical functions
- [x] Create benchmarking utilities

```

### ✅ Ready for Other Teams:
The Core Infrastructure is now complete and ready for other development teams to build upon. All interfaces are defined, tested, and documented.

## Notes
- Following the architecture specification from docs/designs/
- Prioritizing security and determinism over performance optimizations
- Building interfaces first to enable parallel team development
- All cryptographic operations must be constant-time where applicable
