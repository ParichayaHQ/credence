# Credence P2P Networking Implementation

## Current Phase: P2P Networking Layer

### P2P Gateway Service Implementation
- [x] Set up libp2p host with TCP + QUIC transports
- [x] Configure Kademlia DHT for content discovery
- [x] Implement gossipsub with specified mesh parameters
- [x] Create topic management system (events/*, revocations/*, rules/*, checkpoints/*)
- [x] Build HTTP bridge for internal service communication
- [x] Add rate limiting and anti-abuse measures
- [x] Implement blob caching and retrieval via DHT
- [x] Create peer reputation and greylist system
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] Write unit and integration tests
- [x] Add performance benchmarks

## P2P Networking Layer Status: âœ… COMPLETED
All P2P networking components are implemented, tested, and benchmarked:
- libp2p Host (TCP/QUIC, DHT, GossipSub v1.1)
- Topic Management (events/*, revocations/*, rules/*, checkpoints/*, blobs/*)
- HTTP Bridge (internal service communication)
- Rate Limiting & Anti-abuse (peer reputation, greylist)
- Blob Caching & DHT retrieval
- Comprehensive Error Handling & Structured Logging
- Complete Test Suite (unit + integration + benchmarks)
