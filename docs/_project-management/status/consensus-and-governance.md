## Consensus & Governance System

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Design and implement Consensus & Governance system architecture
- [x] Implement checkpoint committee system
- [x] Create BLS threshold signature aggregation
- [x] Build VRF-based committee selection
- [x] Implement rules registry with time-locks
- [x] Create governance proposal system

## Testing Commands

### Run All Consensus Tests
```bash
# Run all consensus and governance tests
go test ./internal/consensus/ -v

# Run specific test suites
go test ./internal/consensus/ -v -run "TestBLS"          # BLS signature tests
go test ./internal/consensus/ -v -run "TestVRF"          # VRF committee selection tests
go test ./internal/consensus/ -v -run "TestCommittee"    # Committee management tests

# Build checkpointor service
go build ./cmd/checkpointor

# Build entire project
go build ./...
```

### Test Coverage
```bash
# Generate test coverage report
go test ./internal/consensus/ -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

## Implementation Details

### Checkpoint Committee System ✅
Based on components.md specifications:
- ✅ Periodically aggregates log roots into checkpoints  
- ✅ Co-signs with rotating committee using BLS threshold signatures
- ✅ Publishes to gossip network and mirrors
- ✅ Implements time-lock windows and committee rotation
- ✅ HTTP API for committee operations
- ✅ Memory storage implementation
- ✅ Full service with graceful shutdown

### BLS Threshold Signature Aggregation ✅  
- ✅ Collect partial BLS signatures from committee members
- ✅ Produce `Checkpoint{root, epoch, signers, sig}` 
- ✅ Verify all partials against same root
- ✅ Slash/downgrade equivocators with reputation events
- ✅ Key generation and signing for testing
- ✅ Complete test suite with 100% pass rate

### VRF-based Committee Selection ✅
- ✅ VRF proof generation and verification
- ✅ Deterministic committee selection from VRF outputs
- ✅ Committee membership management (current/next)
- ✅ VRF seed management (current epoch based)
- ✅ Sortition algorithm for committee selection
- ✅ Ed25519-based VRF implementation
- ✅ Complete test suite with 100% pass rate

### Rules Registry with Time-locks ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive RuleSet structure with scoring weights
- ✅ Vouch budgets per context (general, commerce, hiring)
- ✅ Score caps and decay parameters
- ✅ Committee and network parameters
- ✅ Time-locked proposal execution
- ✅ SHA256 hash commitment system
- ✅ Ed25519 digital signatures

### Governance Proposal System ✅  
- ✅ Committee governance proposal workflow
- ✅ Multi-signature approval process (threshold-based)
- ✅ Time-locked rule changes with configurable delays
- ✅ Proposal lifecycle management (pending → approved → executed)
- ✅ Committee member validation and authorization
- ✅ Comprehensive proposal storage and retrieval
