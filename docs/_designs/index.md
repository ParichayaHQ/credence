## Overview

Credence implements a decentralized trust network with the following key architectural components:

- **P2P Network Layer** - Gossip protocol and DHT-based discovery
- **Storage Layer** - Distributed data storage with multiple backends
- **Consensus Layer** - Proof-of-trust consensus mechanism
- **Identity Layer** - Self-sovereign identity and DID management
- **Credential Layer** - Verifiable credentials and presentations
- **Trust Scoring** - Reputation-based trust metrics

Each component is designed for modularity, scalability, and decentralization while maintaining strong privacy and security guarantees.
